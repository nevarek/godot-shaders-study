# Godot Shaders Study

**GODOT 4.0+ ONLY**

Following Freya Holmer's guide for Unity shaders, I reproduced most of the work done there.

There are a few known bugs and I ended up discovering and fixing ones that I could handle quickly without getting too distracted.

Ultimately a lot of the course was able to be reproduced, though the shader language has been changing every now and then, so syntax could be off. Beware.

Compatibility with 3.X shaders is possible, though working out the differences wouldn't be too hard.
